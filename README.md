# Impact Analysis of GoodThought NGO Initiatives
GoodThought NGO Project
GoodThought NGO has been a catalyst for positive change, focusing on education, healthcare, and sustainable development to make a significant difference in communities worldwide. With this mission, GoodThought has orchestrated an array of assignments aimed at uplifting underprivileged populations and fostering long-term growth.

# Project Overview
This project offers a hands-on opportunity to explore how data-driven insights can direct and enhance humanitarian efforts. I will engage with the GoodThought PostgreSQL database, which encapsulates detailed records of assignments, funding, impacts, and donor activities from 2010 to 2023. The objective is to leverage SQL queries to analyze this data and gain actionable insights.


By analyzing this dataset, I aim to answer the following key questions:

What are the key factors contributing to the success of different assignments?
How are donations distributed across various projects and regions?
What trends can be identified in donor activities and contributions over the years?
Methodology
SQL Queries: I will write and execute SQL queries to extract and analyze data from the PostgreSQL database.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Visualization: Create visualizations to illustrate key findings and insights.
Expected Outcomes
The analysis will provide valuable insights into how GoodThought can optimize its efforts in education, healthcare, and sustainable development. It will help in understanding the impact of different projects, the effectiveness of funding allocations, and the behavior of donors.

# Contribution
This project will contribute to GoodThoughtâ€™s mission by using data to drive better decision-making and strategic planning, ultimately enhancing the NGO's ability to support underprivileged communities.
