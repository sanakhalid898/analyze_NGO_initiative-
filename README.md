# analyze_NGO_initiative-
I will explore GoodThought NGO’s PostgreSQL database (2010-2023) to analyze assignments, donations, and donors. This project aims to gain insights into funding, impacts, and donor activities through SQL queries. My goal is to support GoodThought’s mission in education, healthcare, and sustainable development by leveraging data-driven insights.
